processRequest:
if valid request (status code == 0)
    routeRequest

else (error)
    responseBuilder
-----------------------------------

routeRequest:
if the uri exists in the server map created from the config file
    - creates the relative path to the actual location in the server
    if the path accepts the requested method
        - continues
    else   
        - sets the status code to the specific error
    if status code is still 0
        if the requested content is static
            - call staticContentHandler
        else
            - call CGI module

else
    - sets the status code to the specific error
(goes back to processRequest and calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------


staticContentHandler:
if GET
    - serveStaticFile

else if POST
    - uploadFile

else (DELETE)
    - deleteFile
(goes back to routeRequest, from there to processRequest and calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------

serveStaticFile:
if file can be opened
    - read the file into a buffer or the body variable of response object
    - sets the status code to 200
else
    - sets the status code to forbidden
(returns to staticContentHandler and from there to routeRequest to processRequest and continues calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------

uploadFile:
create file with the in the request specified name at the specified location
opens the file
writes the body of the request to the file
sets status code to 201 (created)

-----------------------------------

deleteFile:
if file doesn't exist (might not be needed since if the uri doesn't exist in the server map, the status code is set to 404 before already)
    - sets status code to 404 (not found)
else
    - tries to delete the file specified in the request
        - if successfully deleted sets status code to 204 (no content)
        - if not sets status code to 403 (forbidden) if no permissions 


-----------------------------------


serveErrorFile:
get path to error file using created map from config file
if error code doesn't exist in map
    - createDefaultErrorFile
else
    - serveStaticFile
-----------------------------------


createDefaultErrorFile:

-----------------------------------


responseBuilder:



*** set 500 (internal server error) if other errors happen during execution?
