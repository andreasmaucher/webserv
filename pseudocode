processRequest:
if valid request (status code == 0)
    routeRequest

responseBuilder (errors comming from calling function go directly here)
-----------------------------------


routeRequest:
if the uri (location) exists in the server map (or vector of Route class) created from the config file
    if the path accepts the requested method (check also in the map or set created from config file)
        - creates the relative path to the actual location in the server
    else   
        - sets the status code to the specific error and returns
    if the requested content is static
        - call staticContentHandler
    else
        - call CGI module

else
    - sets the status code to the specific error
(goes back to processRequest and calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------


staticContentHandler:
if GET
    - serveStaticFile

else if POST
    - uploadFile

else (DELETE)
    - deleteFile
(goes back to routeRequest, from there to processRequest and calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------


serveStaticFile:
if file exists & can be opened
    - read the file into a buffer or the body variable of response object (files won't be too big, so no chunking needed)
    - sets the status code to 200
    - set content type based on the file extension or MIME type
else
    - sets the status code to forbidden or not found
(returns to staticContentHandler and from there to routeRequest to processRequest and continues calls responseBuilder)
-----------------------------------


uploadFile:
create file with the in the request specified name at the specified location
opens the file
writes the body of the request to the file
sets status code to 201 (created)
//serveStaticFile (passing path to 201.html) // avoid using this function and create a specific function for custom html pages like for errors?

-----------------------------------


deleteFile:
if file doesn't exist
    - sets status code to 404 (not found)
else
    - tries to delete the file (or empty directories only) specified in the request
    --> (remove(file_path.c_str()) checks if file exists & permissions and deletes it) returns 0 on success
    --> check for file existence and permissions before trying to delete to set the error code accordingly, since not allowed to use errno
    --> implement full directory deletion if full?
        - if successfully deleted sets status code to 204 (no content)
        - if not sets status code to 403 (forbidden) if no permissions 

-----------------------------------


serveErrorFile:
get path to error file using created map from config file
if error code doesn't exist in map
    get path to 666 Random Error (create custom html file for this)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



responseBuilder: (CGI module will also call this function)
(for successful GET at this point body of response object should be filled with the content of the requested file to serve unless it's an error)
(for successful POST or DELETE at this point body of response object should be empty and status code should be set to 200, 201 or 204)
if status code is != 0 (also exclude 200 and other success codes??!)
    - call serveErrorFile
populate response line with request status code & message (from map or switch case)
set headers (check for mandatory, content type, content length (size of ready body),  connection etc. &  specific headers like allow for 405)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** set 500 (internal server error) if other errors happen during execution?
*** create custom HTML files for errors, default error and 200, 201, 204 (body of response)
