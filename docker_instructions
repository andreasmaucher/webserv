1. Download Dockerfile and runwebsrv.sh script and save in root directory (if not icluded already)
2. Build the Docker Image running "docker build -t webserv-img ." in the root dir
3. Optional:
   Add the runwebsrv.sh script to your zsh:
   Open your ZSH config file, probably: touch ~/.zshrc
   Add alias, example : alias runwebsrv="/Users/mrizhakov/Desktop/Docker/runwebsrv.sh"
   Update the zsh settings: source ~/.zshrc
   ...
   Profit
   If you dont have zsh - get it !
4. Run the script using ./runwebserv.sh or your created alias
   -> The current folder you are in (root of repository) will be mounted into home/root in the container,
   so make sure to have all the needed files there
5. Have fun coding from inside the container :)
