In HTTP/1.1, the default behavior is to keep connections open after sending a response, which is known as persistent connections. This is different from HTTP/1.0, where connections are closed by default unless explicitly kept open. However, you don’t always have to keep the connection open in HTTP/1.1. Here’s a breakdown of when to keep the connection open and when to close it:

1. Persistent Connections in HTTP/1.1 by Default
Without Connection: close: If the client’s request does not specify Connection: close, HTTP/1.1 expects the connection to remain open. This allows the client to send additional requests on the same connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for every request.
Benefit: This is more efficient for both the client and server, as it minimizes the resources needed for connection setup and teardown and reduces latency.
2. Using Connection: close to Close the Connection
If either the client or the server includes Connection: close in their headers, then the connection should be closed after the current request/response is complete.
Server-Side Control: If your server needs to manage resources or limit the number of simultaneous connections, you may include Connection: close in the response headers. This informs the client that the server will close the connection after this response.
When to Use Connection: close:
If the server is low on resources or wants to limit persistent connections.
When handling clients that don’t need to maintain a persistent connection, such as single-request clients.
For simple servers, where keeping connections open doesn’t offer significant benefits, it can be safer and simpler to close connections after each response.
3. How to Handle the Connection: close Header
If a client sends a request with Connection: close, the server should respond, send Connection: close in the response headers (though this is not strictly required), and close the connection afterward.
If the server wants to close the connection for any reason, it should include Connection: close in the response and then close the connection after sending the response.
