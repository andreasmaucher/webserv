3. Simulate Limited Buffer Size in Your ServerFor testing purposes, if your server has a buffer size setting (e.g., BUFFER_SIZE), set it smaller than the body of the incoming request. This allows you to verify that:The server can handle reading in multiple iterations.The content is correctly reassembled after reading the data from the socket in pieces.For instance, if your body is around 10KB, set your buffer size to 1KB or smaller. Your server’s read loop should continue reading from the socket until it receives the entire body, based on Content-Length or the closing of the connection.4. Testing Edge CasesTo further ensure robustness, test cases like:Exactly Buffer-Sized Requests: Create a body that matches the buffer size to test edge handling.Requests Slightly Larger Than the Buffer: This helps you check if the server efficiently reads the overflow correctly.Massive Bodies: Test with much larger payloads to see if the server’s memory usage and processing are efficient.
